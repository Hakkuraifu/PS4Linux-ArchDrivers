## Why this repo ?
To keep the drivers update, and also like that peoples can 'convert' they own distro easily.

## How i install the drivers ?
If you want to install the drivers using the precompiled files just use ```sudo pacman -U``` in the 'Compiled/x86_64' folder for each files.

If you want to compile and install the drivers just use ```makepkg -sri``` in for each folder inside 'SRC'.
